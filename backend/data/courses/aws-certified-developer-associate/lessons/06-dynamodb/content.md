# DynamoDB

## Overview

Master Amazon DynamoDB - AWS's fully managed NoSQL database service that provides fast, predictable performance at any scale with automatic scaling, built-in security, and in-memory caching.

## Alex's Story

PetTracker's PostgreSQL database is struggling. Different pet types need different attributes - dogs have breeds, fish have tank requirements, exotic pets have special permits. The rigid schema requires constant migrations. Elena suggests DynamoDB for its flexibility, but Alex must learn a completely new way of thinking about data modeling.

## What You'll Learn

- Design effective DynamoDB tables with proper key selection
- Implement Global and Local Secondary Indexes
- Write efficient queries and understand when to use Scan
- Configure capacity modes and auto-scaling
- Implement DynamoDB Streams for event-driven architectures
- Use transactions and batch operations

## Key Topics

1. **Fundamentals** - Tables, items, attributes, data types
2. **Primary Keys** - Partition keys, sort keys, composite keys
3. **Indexes** - GSI vs LSI, when to use each
4. **Operations** - Query vs Scan, batch operations
5. **Advanced Features** - Streams, transactions, TTL, DAX

## Prerequisites

- Understanding of database concepts
- Familiarity with JSON
- Basic AWS SDK knowledge
