      "type": "multiple_choice",
      "difficulty": 2,
      "concept": "Client vs Resource",
      "question": "What is the difference between Boto3's Client and Resource APIs?",
      "options": [
        "Client is for Python 2, Resource is for Python 3",
        "Client provides low-level 1:1 API mapping, Resource provides high-level object-oriented interface",
        "Resource is faster than Client",
        "Client requires credentials, Resource uses anonymous access"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Client provides direct 1:1 mapping to AWS API operations with dictionary responses. Resource provides a cleaner object-oriented interface with attributes and methods. Use Client when Resource doesn't support the operation."

      "id": "q2",
      "type": "code_analysis",
      "difficulty": 3,
      "concept": "DynamoDB Decimal",
      "question": "Why will this code fail?",
      "codeSnippet": "table.put_item(Item={\n    'PetId': 'pet-001',\n    'Weight': 25.5  # Python float\n})",
      "language": "python",
      "options": [
        "DynamoDB doesn't support numeric values",
        "DynamoDB doesn't accept Python floats - use Decimal instead",
        "The table name is missing",
        "put_item requires a different syntax"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "DynamoDB doesn't accept Python floats. Use Decimal from the decimal module: Decimal('25.5'). This is a common gotcha when working with DynamoDB in Python."

      "id": "q3",
      "type": "multiple_select",
      "difficulty": 4,
      "concept": "Pagination Handling",
      "question": "How can you handle pagination when querying DynamoDB with Boto3? (Select ALL that apply)",
      "options": [
        "Check for 'LastEvaluatedKey' in the response and loop with ExclusiveStartKey",
        "Use a Paginator from the client",
        "Set 'AllItems=True' parameter to get all results",

      ],
      "correctIndices": [0, 1],
      "minSelections": 1,
      "maxSelections": 4,
      "explanation": "Handle pagination by checking LastEvaluatedKey and looping, or use the cleaner Paginator API. There's no 'AllItems' parameter, and Limit doesn't guarantee all results."

      "type": "code_analysis",

      "concept": "Pre-signed URLs",
      "question": "What does this code generate?",

      "language": "python",
      "options": [
        "A permanent public URL for the S3 object",
        "A temporary URL that allows downloading the object for 1 hour without AWS credentials",
        "A URL that uploads files to S3",
        "An error because S3 objects can't be shared"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "generate_presigned_url creates a temporary URL allowing access to the S3 object without AWS credentials. ExpiresIn=3600 means it's valid for 1 hour (3600 seconds)."
    },

      "id": "q5",
      "type": "true_false",
      "difficulty": 3,
      "concept": "Lambda Initialization",
      "question": "In AWS Lambda, you should create Boto3 clients inside the handler function for each invocation.",
      "correctAnswer": false,
      "explanation": "Create clients OUTSIDE the handler function. They persist across warm starts, avoiding repeated initialization overhead. Only the handler function is called on each invocation."

      "correctPairs": [[0, 3], [1, 2], [2, 0], [3, 1]],
      "explanation": "Session manages configuration/credentials. Client provides low-level API access. Resource provides high-level OOP interface. Waiter polls until an operation completes."
