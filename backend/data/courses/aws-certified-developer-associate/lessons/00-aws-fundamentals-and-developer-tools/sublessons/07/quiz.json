      "question": "What is the primary purpose of AWS SDKs?",
      "options": [
        "To replace the AWS Management Console",
        "To interact with AWS services programmatically from application code",
        "To provide a graphical interface for AWS services",
        "To monitor AWS costs and usage"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "AWS SDKs let you interact with AWS services directly from your application code in various programming languages, enabling automation and integration."

        "The region is not specified",
        "Credentials are hardcoded - they should be resolved automatically",
        "The boto3 import is incorrect",
        "Nothing is wrong with this code"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Never hardcode credentials! Let the SDK resolve them automatically through the credential chain (environment variables, config files, IAM roles). Hardcoded keys can be leaked in code repositories."

      "explanation": "SDKs check: 1) Explicitly passed credentials, 2) Environment variables, 3) Shared credentials file, 4) Instance profile (for EC2/Lambda). Higher priority sources override lower ones."

      "options": [
        "v3 is free while v2 costs money",
        "v3 has modular imports, better TypeScript support, and smaller bundle sizes",

        "v2 is no longer maintained or functional"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "SDK v3 offers modular imports (install only what you need), first-class TypeScript support, better tree-shaking, and middleware customization. v2 still works but v3 is the modern approach."
