      "id": "q1",
      "type": "multiple_choice",
      "difficulty": 2,
      "concept": "AWS Regions",
      "question": "What is an AWS Region?",
      "options": [
        "A single data center building",
        "A physical geographic location with multiple Availability Zones",
        "A virtual network within AWS",
        "An edge caching location for CloudFront"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "A Region is a physical geographic location (like N. Virginia or Ireland) containing multiple isolated Availability Zones. Each Region is completely independent and isolated from other Regions."
    },
    {
      "id": "q2",
      "type": "true_false",
      "difficulty": 1,
      "concept": "Service Availability",
      "question": "All AWS services are available in every AWS Region.",
      "correctAnswer": false,
      "explanation": "New services typically launch in us-east-1 first, then expand to other regions over time. Always check service availability in your chosen region before designing your architecture."
    },

      "id": "q3",
      "type": "multiple_select",
      "difficulty": 3,
      "concept": "Region Selection",
      "question": "Which factors should influence your choice of AWS Region? (Select ALL that apply)",
      "options": [
        "Proximity to your users (latency)",
        "Data residency and compliance requirements",
        "Service availability for features you need",
        "The region name sounds interesting"
      ],
      "correctIndices": [0, 1, 2],
      "minSelections": 2,
      "maxSelections": 4,
      "explanation": "Region selection should be based on latency (closer to users is better), compliance requirements (data residency laws), and service availability. The region name is not a technical consideration."

      "id": "q4",
      "type": "code_analysis",

      "concept": "AWS CLI Regions",
      "question": "What will this AWS CLI command output?",
      "codeSnippet": "aws ec2 describe-regions --output table",
      "language": "bash",
      "options": [
        "A list of Availability Zones in the current region",
        "A table showing all available AWS Regions and their endpoints",
        "Information about EC2 instances in all regions",
        "Error: region parameter required"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "The describe-regions command lists all available AWS Regions with their endpoints. The --output table flag formats it as a human-readable table."

      "rightColumn": ["Fault-tolerant data centers within a region", "Content caching close to users", "Geographic isolation for compliance and latency"],
      "correctPairs": [[0, 2], [1, 0], [2, 1]],
      "explanation": "Regions provide geographic isolation. AZs provide fault tolerance within a region. Edge Locations cache content closer to users for low latency."
    },
    {
      "id": "q6",
      "type": "multiple_choice",
      "difficulty": 2,
      "concept": "Availability Zones",
      "question": "How are Availability Zones within the same Region connected?",
      "options": [
        "Public internet with VPN encryption",
        "High-speed, low-latency private fiber with less than 2ms latency",
        "Satellite communication links",
        "They are not connected to each other"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "AZs within a region are connected via high-speed, low-latency private fiber connections with less than 2ms latency. This enables synchronous replication while maintaining physical isolation."
