      "question": "What is the primary purpose of AWS Edge Locations?",
      "options": [
        "Running EC2 instances closer to users",
        "Caching content and serving it with low latency to users globally",
        "Storing S3 data redundantly",
        "Managing IAM permissions at the edge"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Edge Locations are AWS's globally distributed network of servers (400+) designed primarily for caching content closer to users via CloudFront, reducing latency significantly."

      "explanation": "CloudFront (CDN), Route 53 (DNS), and Lambda@Edge run at edge locations. EC2 and RDS run in regional data centers, not at edge locations."

      "options": [
        "When you need to make network calls to external services",
        "When you need simple, fast transformations with sub-millisecond execution",

        "When you need up to 30 seconds of execution time"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "CloudFront Functions are ideal for simple, lightweight operations (URL rewrites, header manipulation) with sub-millisecond execution and lower cost. Lambda@Edge is for complex logic requiring network access or longer execution."

      "explanation": "This creates a CloudFront distribution using the S3 bucket as the origin. Content from pettracker-images.s3.amazonaws.com will be cached at edge locations globally."
