      "type": "multiple_choice",
      "difficulty": 2,
      "concept": "Credentials Storage",
      "question": "Where does the AWS CLI store credentials after running 'aws configure'?",
      "options": [
        "/etc/aws/credentials",
        "~/.aws/credentials",
        "~/.bashrc",
        "/usr/local/aws/config"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "The AWS CLI stores credentials in ~/.aws/credentials and configuration settings in ~/.aws/config. These are in your home directory and are user-specific."

      "type": "true_false",
      "difficulty": 1,
      "concept": "Root Account Security",
      "question": "It's recommended to create access keys for the root account for CLI access.",
      "correctAnswer": false,
      "explanation": "Never create access keys for the root account. Root has unrestricted access and can't be limited by IAM policies. Always create IAM users with appropriate permissions instead."

      "language": "bash",
      "options": [
        "The current AWS region setting",
        "The UserId, Account number, and ARN of the current credentials",
        "A list of all IAM users in the account",
        "The access key being used"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "get-caller-identity returns the UserId, Account number, and ARN of the entity making the call. It's the 'who am I?' command for AWS - essential for verifying which credentials are active."

        "json",
        "table",

      "explanation": "AWS CLI supports json (default), table (human-readable), text (scriptable), and yaml. CSV is not a native output format."

        "~/.aws/credentials file",
        "Command line --profile option",
        "EC2 Instance Profile",
        "Environment variables (AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID)"
      ],
      "correctOrder": [1, 3, 0, 2],
      "explanation": "Command line options have highest priority, then environment variables, then credentials file, and finally instance profile (lowest). This allows overriding at any level."

      "question": "What is the recommended way for an application on EC2 to access AWS services?",
      "options": [
        "Store access keys in environment variables on the instance",
        "Hardcode access keys in the application code",
        "Use an IAM instance profile (IAM role)",
        "Use the root account access keys"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "IAM instance profiles (roles) are the recommended way. Credentials are automatically rotated by AWS, never stored on disk, and can be managed through IAM policies."
