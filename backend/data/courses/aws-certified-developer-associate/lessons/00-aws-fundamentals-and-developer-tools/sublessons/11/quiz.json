      "options": [

      "correctIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Setting up billing alerts and budgets should be your FIRST action. This protects you from unexpected charges and surprise bills, especially when learning AWS."

      "options": [
        "Always Free (forever)",
        "12 Months Free (new accounts)",
        "Short-term Trials (service-specific)",

      "maxSelections": 4,
      "explanation": "AWS Free Tier has three types: Always Free (Lambda, DynamoDB limits), 12 Months Free for new accounts (EC2, S3), and Short-term Trials for specific services. There's no unlimited free tier."

      "explanation": "NAT Gateway costs ~$32/month minimum. Unused Elastic IPs incur charges. CloudWatch Logs accumulate forever unless you set retention. Cross-AZ transfer costs $0.01/GB each way."

        "IAM sessions from lasting longer than 7 days"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "This sets a 7-day retention policy on CloudWatch Logs. By default, logs are kept forever and can accumulate significant storage costs. Set retention based on your compliance and debugging needs."

      "concept": "Data Transfer",
      "question": "Data transfer INTO AWS from the internet is generally free.",
      "correctAnswer": true,
      "explanation": "Inbound data transfer from the internet to AWS is typically free. However, outbound transfer TO the internet costs money ($0.09/GB for the first 10TB). Cross-region and cross-AZ transfers also have costs."

      "concept": "VPC Endpoints",
      "question": "How can you reduce costs when a Lambda in a VPC needs to access DynamoDB?",
      "options": [
        "Move Lambda outside the VPC",
        "Use a NAT Gateway ($32+/month)",
        "Create a VPC Endpoint for DynamoDB (~$7/month)",
        "Use public internet routing"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "VPC Endpoints provide private access to AWS services without NAT Gateway. They're much cheaper (~$7/month vs $32+/month for NAT) and keep traffic within AWS network."
