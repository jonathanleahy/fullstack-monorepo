      "Question": "According to the lesson, where should logging be implemented in BookShelf to avoid polluting the domain?",
      "Options": [
        "Inside domain entities like Book and User",
        "In use cases before each operation",
        "As decorators or middleware in the adapter layer",
        "In a global logging singleton"
      ],
      "CorrectIndex": 2,
      "Explanation": "Cross-cutting concerns like logging should be implemented in the adapter layer as decorators or middleware. This keeps the domain pure while still providing full observability."
    },
    {
      "ID": "patterns-q2",
      "Type": "true-false",
      "Question": "According to the lesson, caching in Hexagonal Architecture should be implemented inside the domain layer for best performance.",
      "CorrectAnswer": false,
      "Explanation": "Caching should be implemented as a decorator adapter that wraps the real repository. The domain stays pure, and the caching adapter transparently adds caching behavior."
    },

      "ID": "patterns-q3",
      "Type": "multiple-select",
      "Question": "According to the lesson, which cross-cutting concerns did Sam need to add to BookShelf for production? Select ALL that apply.",
      "Options": [
        "Transaction logging",
        "Caching for popular books",
        "Metrics and monitoring",
        "Direct database access from handlers"
      ],
      "CorrectIndices": [0, 1, 2],
      "Explanation": "Sam needed to add logging, caching, and metrics - all implemented in the adapter layer. Direct database access from handlers would violate hexagonal principles."
    },

      "ID": "patterns-q4",
      "Type": "fill-blank",
      "Question": "According to the lesson, _______ events allow loose coupling between different parts of the system by publishing what happened rather than directly calling other services.",
      "CorrectAnswers": ["Domain", "domain", "DOMAIN"],
      "CaseSensitive": false,
      "Explanation": "Domain events (like BookBorrowed, LoanOverdue) enable event-driven patterns. Components publish events about what happened, and other components react to those events."
