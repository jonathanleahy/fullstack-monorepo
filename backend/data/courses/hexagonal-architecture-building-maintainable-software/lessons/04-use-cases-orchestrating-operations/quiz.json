      "Type": "multiple-choice",
      "Question": "According to the lesson, what does Sam's BorrowBookUseCase coordinate?",
      "Options": [
        "Only database queries",
        "HTTP request handling and JSON serialization",
        "User validation, book availability, loan creation, and notifications",
        "Frontend form validation"
      ],
      "CorrectIndex": 2,
      "Explanation": "The BorrowBookUseCase orchestrates multiple operations: checking user borrowing limits, verifying book availability, creating a loan, and sending notifications - all while staying independent of HTTP."
    },
    {
      "ID": "usecases-q2",
      "Type": "true-false",
      "Question": "According to the lesson, use cases should know about HTTP status codes and return them directly to handlers.",
      "CorrectAnswer": false,
      "Explanation": "Use cases should return domain errors. HTTP adapters translate these domain errors to appropriate HTTP status codes. Use cases are independent of delivery mechanisms."
    },
    {
      "ID": "usecases-q3",
      "Type": "multiple-select",
      "Question": "According to the lesson, which of the following are benefits of Sam's thin HTTP handlers after implementing use cases? Select ALL that apply.",
      "Options": [
        "Handlers only translate HTTP to use case calls",
        "Business logic can be tested without HTTP",
        "Adding a CLI or GraphQL interface reuses the same use cases",
        "Handlers contain all validation and business rules"
      ],
      "CorrectIndices": [0, 1, 2],
      "Explanation": "With use cases, handlers become thin translators. Business logic is testable in isolation, and new interfaces (CLI, GraphQL) simply call the same use cases. Business rules are NOT in handlers."
    },

      "Type": "fill-blank",
      "Question": "According to the lesson, each use case represents a single _______ operation that the application supports.",
      "CorrectAnswers": ["business", "Business", "BUSINESS"],
      "CaseSensitive": false,
      "Explanation": "Use cases are 'single business operations as first-class citizens.' BorrowBook, ReturnBook, SearchBooks are each one complete business operation."
