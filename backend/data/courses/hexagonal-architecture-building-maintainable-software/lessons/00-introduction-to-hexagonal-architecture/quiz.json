      "Type": "multiple-choice",
      "Question": "According to the lesson, what was Sam's main problem with the original BookShelf codebase?",
      "Options": [
        "The code was too slow to run",
        "Database queries and business logic were tightly coupled throughout the codebase",
        "There weren't enough features",
        "The user interface was outdated"
      ],
      "CorrectIndex": 1,
      "Explanation": "Sam's challenge showed that database queries were scattered throughout HTTP handlers and business logic was mixed with JSON serialization - making it impossible to add mobile apps or switch databases without rewriting everything."
    },
    {
      "ID": "intro-q2",
      "Type": "true-false",
      "Question": "According to the lesson, in Hexagonal Architecture, your business logic should know about and directly depend on the database implementation.",
      "CorrectAnswer": false,
      "Explanation": "The core principle is that 'Your business logic should not know or care about the outside world.' The domain core is isolated from infrastructure concerns like databases."

      "ID": "intro-q3",
      "Type": "multiple-select",
      "Question": "According to the course overview, which of the following can BookShelf support after applying Hexagonal Architecture? Select ALL that apply.",
      "Options": [
        "Multiple interfaces (REST, GraphQL, gRPC, mobile apps)",
        "Different databases (PostgreSQL, SQLite, Oracle)",
        "Only cloud deployment",
        "Independent testing at every layer"
      ],
      "CorrectIndices": [0, 1, 3],
      "Explanation": "The lesson states BookShelf can support multiple interfaces, different databases, deploy anywhere (cloud, on-premise, embedded), and be tested independently. Only cloud deployment is incorrect - it can deploy anywhere."

      "Question": "According to the hexagon diagram, the _______ Core sits at the center of the architecture, surrounded by adapters.",
      "CorrectAnswers": ["Domain", "domain", "DOMAIN"],
      "CaseSensitive": false,
      "Explanation": "The hexagon diagram shows the Domain Core (green) at the center, with Driving Adapters and Driven Adapters connecting it to the outside world."
