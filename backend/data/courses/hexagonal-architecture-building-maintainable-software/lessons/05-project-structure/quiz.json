      "ID": "structure-q1",
      "Type": "multiple-choice",
      "Question": "According to the lesson, Sam's BookShelf went from a 1,200-line main.go to what kind of structure?",
      "Options": [
        "Multiple main.go files in different folders",
        "Organized directories: domain/, application/, ports/, adapters/, cmd/",
        "One file per function",
        "A single large package with clear comments"
      ],
      "CorrectIndex": 1,
      "Explanation": "Sam restructured BookShelf with clear directories: domain/ for pure business logic, application/ for use cases, ports/ for interfaces, adapters/ for implementations, and cmd/ for entry points."
    },
    {
      "ID": "structure-q2",
      "Type": "true-false",
      "Question": "According to the lesson, the cmd/ directory contains all the business logic and domain entities.",
      "CorrectAnswer": false,
      "Explanation": "The cmd/ directory contains entry points and dependency wiring - where concrete adapters are instantiated and injected. Business logic lives in domain/, and entities are in domain/."
    },
    {
      "ID": "structure-q3",
      "Type": "multiple-select",
      "Question": "According to the dependency direction rule, which of the following imports are CORRECT? Select ALL that apply.",
      "Options": [
        "adapters/postgres imports domain/",
        "domain/ imports adapters/postgres",
        "application/ imports domain/",
        "domain/ imports application/"
      ],
      "CorrectIndices": [0, 2],
      "Explanation": "Dependencies point INWARD. Adapters can import domain (outer → inner), and application can import domain. Domain should NEVER import adapters or application (inner → outer is wrong)."
    },
    {
      "ID": "structure-q4",
      "Type": "fill-blank",
      "Question": "According to the lesson, dependencies always point _______ toward the domain layer.",
      "CorrectAnswers": ["inward", "Inward", "INWARD", "in", "In"],
      "CaseSensitive": false,
      "Explanation": "The dependency direction rule states that outer layers depend on inner layers. Adapters depend on ports, which depend on domain. Never the reverse."
