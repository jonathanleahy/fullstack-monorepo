      "Options": [
        "The application ran faster than before",
        "How easily a mobile API could be added without changing business logic",
        "The use of the latest JavaScript framework",
        "The lower hosting costs"
      ],
      "CorrectIndex": 1,
      "Explanation": "Maya was impressed that adding mobile app support (a new driving adapter) didn't require changing any business logic - just adding a new adapter that calls the same use cases."

      "Question": "According to the lesson, Chen's on-premise requirement was solved by adding SQLite as an alternative driven adapter for the BookRepository port.",
      "CorrectAnswer": true,

      "Question": "According to the 'Complete Picture' section, which of the following are benefits Sam gained from Hexagonal Architecture? Select ALL that apply.",
      "Options": [
        "Testability - domain can be tested without infrastructure",
        "Flexibility - swap adapters without changing business logic",
        "Faster database queries",
        "Maintainability - clear boundaries make changes safer"
      ],
      "CorrectIndices": [0, 1, 3],
      "Explanation": "The three core benefits are testability, flexibility, and maintainability. Database query speed is determined by the adapter implementation, not the architecture pattern itself."

      "Question": "According to the Common Pitfalls section, putting business logic in HTTP handlers instead of the domain is called having an _______ domain model.",
      "CorrectAnswers": ["anemic", "Anemic", "ANEMIC"],
      "CaseSensitive": false,
      "Explanation": "An anemic domain model has entities that are just data containers, with all logic in services or handlers. This scatters business rules and breaks encapsulation."
