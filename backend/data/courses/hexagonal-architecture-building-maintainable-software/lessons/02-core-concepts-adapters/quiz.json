      "Question": "According to the lesson, Sam realized BookShelf could support both Maya's cloud deployment and Chen's on-premise requirement by:",
      "Options": [
        "Writing two separate applications",
        "Creating PostgresBookRepository and SQLiteBookRepository adapters for the same port",
        "Adding if-statements throughout the codebase",
        "Using a cross-platform database"
      ],
      "CorrectIndex": 1,
      "Explanation": "Sam's excitement came from realizing that different adapters (PostgreSQL, SQLite) can implement the same BookRepository port, allowing different deployments without changing business logic."

      "Type": "true-false",
      "Question": "According to the lesson, an HTTP handler that receives requests and calls the BookService port is an example of a driving (inbound) adapter.",
      "CorrectAnswer": true,
      "Explanation": "Driving adapters receive requests from the outside world and translate them into port calls. HTTP handlers, CLI commands, and GraphQL resolvers are all driving adapters - they DRIVE the application."

      "Question": "According to the lesson, which of the following are examples of DRIVEN (outbound) adapters? Select ALL that apply.",
      "Options": [
        "REST API handler",
        "PostgresBookRepository",
        "SendGridEmailSender",
        "CLI command handler"
      ],
      "CorrectIndices": [1, 2],
      "Explanation": "PostgresBookRepository and SendGridEmailSender are driven adapters - they implement driven ports and connect to external systems. REST and CLI handlers are driving adapters that receive external requests."

      "Question": "According to the lesson, adapters can be _______ without changing the business logic, which is the key power of Hexagonal Architecture.",
      "CorrectAnswers": ["swapped", "Swapped", "replaced", "Replaced", "switched", "Switched"],
      "CaseSensitive": false,
      "Explanation": "The lesson emphasizes 'The Power of Swappable Adapters' - you can switch from PostgreSQL to MongoDB, or from SendGrid to Mailgun, without touching domain code."
