    {
      "ID": "testing-q1",
      "Type": "multiple-choice",
      "Question": "According to the lesson, Sam went from 0% test coverage to what percentage after applying hexagonal testing strategies?",
      "Options": [
        "25%",
        "50%",
        "85%",
        "100%"
      ],
      "CorrectIndex": 2,
      "Explanation": "Sam's story shows going from 0% to 85% test coverage in a week by applying the testing pyramid: pure domain tests, use case tests with mocks, and integration tests for adapters."
    },
    {
      "ID": "testing-q2",
      "Type": "true-false",
      "Question": "According to the lesson, domain layer tests require mock objects because the domain depends on database interfaces.",
      "CorrectAnswer": false,
      "Explanation": "Domain tests are PURE unit tests that need NO mocks! The domain layer has no external dependencies, so you can test entities and value objects directly without any mocking."
    },
    {
      "ID": "testing-q3",
      "Type": "multiple-select",
      "Question": "According to the testing pyramid, which layers require integration tests with REAL dependencies? Select ALL that apply.",
      "Options": [
        "Domain layer (entities, value objects)",
        "Driven adapters (database repositories)",
        "Use cases (application layer)",
        "Driving adapters (HTTP handlers with full stack)"
      ],
      "CorrectIndices": [1, 3],
      "Explanation": "Adapters require integration tests with real dependencies. Database repositories need real databases (or testcontainers). E2E tests through driving adapters test the full stack. Domain and use cases use unit tests."
    },
    {
      "ID": "testing-q4",
      "Type": "fill-blank",
      "Question": "According to the lesson, use cases should be tested with _______ adapters that implement the port interfaces.",
      "CorrectAnswers": ["mock", "Mock", "MOCK", "fake", "Fake", "in-memory", "InMemory"],
      "CaseSensitive": false,
      "Explanation": "Use cases are tested with mock/fake adapters injected through the constructor. For example, InMemoryBookRepository implements BookRepository for fast, isolated testing."
