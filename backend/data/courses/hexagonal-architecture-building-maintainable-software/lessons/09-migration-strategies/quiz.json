      "ID": "migration-q1",
      "Type": "multiple-choice",
      "Question": "According to the lesson, what migration pattern did Sam teach Riley to use for PetAdopt?",
      "Options": [
        "Big Bang Rewrite - rewrite everything at once",
        "Strangler Fig Pattern - gradually replace old code",
        "Feature Toggle Pattern - hide new code behind flags",
        "Blue-Green Deployment - run two complete systems"
      ],
      "CorrectIndex": 1,
      "Explanation": "Sam recommended the Strangler Fig Pattern, where new hexagonal code gradually replaces old code like a strangler fig tree enveloping its host - no risky big-bang rewrites."
    },
    {
      "ID": "migration-q2",
      "Type": "true-false",
      "Question": "According to the lesson, a big-bang rewrite is the recommended approach because it's faster than incremental migration.",
      "CorrectAnswer": false,
      "Explanation": "The lesson explicitly warns against big-bang rewrites. They're risky, often fail, and delay value delivery. Incremental migration with the Strangler Fig pattern is safer and delivers value continuously."

      "ID": "migration-q3",
      "Type": "multiple-select",
      "Question": "According to the lesson, what were the results of Riley's PetAdopt migration? Select ALL that apply.",
      "Options": [
        "Test coverage went from 0% to 81%",
        "Deploy time dropped from 2 hours to 15 minutes",
        "The migration took 4 weeks of incremental work",
        "They had to stop all development during migration"
      ],
      "CorrectIndices": [0, 1, 2],
      "Explanation": "Riley's migration achieved 81% coverage, 15-minute deploys, in 4 weeks of incremental work. The key benefit was that development continued throughout - they didn't have to stop."

      "Question": "According to the lesson, the first step in migration is to _______ the domain by moving business logic out of handlers into pure domain objects.",
      "CorrectAnswers": ["extract", "Extract", "EXTRACT"],
      "CaseSensitive": false,
      "Explanation": "The migration strategy starts with extracting the domain - identifying business rules in handlers and moving them into proper entities and value objects in a pure domain layer."
